# Cryptography exercises

This repository contains solutions to cryptography exercises, focusing on implementing various cryptographic algorithms from scratch. It demonstrates both classical and modern encryption techniques and is intended for learning and practice purposes.

## Contents

Pseudorandom number generation: BBS.

Symmetric encryption: AES (with block modes).

Asymmetric encryption: RSA, Diffie–Hellman key exchange.

Hash functions: SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3, MD5.

Image watermarking: Patchwork.

Visual encryption.


# Purpose

To practice and understand how different cryptographic algorithms work internally.

To provide a reference for educational purposes or personal learning projects.


# Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in a standalone jupyter notebook. You can navigate to their directory in run the Untitled.ipynb notebook.

# Requirements

Python 3.x
